(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.

Query:

WITH MultipleDepartments AS (
SELECT employee_id, department_id FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
),

SingleDepartments AS (
SELECT employee_id, department_id FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(department_id) = 1
)

SELECT employee_id, department_id FROM MultipleDepartments 
UNION 
SELECT employee_id, department_id FROM SingleDepartments
