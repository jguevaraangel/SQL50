(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.

Query:

WITH first_logins AS (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
)

SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT f.player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM 
    first_logins AS f
JOIN 
    Activity AS a
    ON f.player_id = a.player_id 
    AND a.event_date = f.first_login + INTERVAL 1 DAY;
