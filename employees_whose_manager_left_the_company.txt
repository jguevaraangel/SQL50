In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
Query:

SELECT a.employee_id FROM Employees AS a
LEFT JOIN Employees AS b
ON a.manager_id = b.employee_id
WHERE a.salary < 30000
AND a.manager_id IS NOT NULL 
AND b.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY a.employee_id
